# Ride-Sharing-App
This is the first step of my ride sharing app that I made as part of my Distributed Systems course. This is a simple Ride Sharing App using distributed systems. There's a client bot which sends request to server with a 1 second interval. The server waits for 5 second and sends the best matching driver to the client.
